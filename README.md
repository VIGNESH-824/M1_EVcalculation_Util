# M1_EVcalculation_Util
An utility to help for calculation of Power Train components of an Electric Vehicle.

## Information
The main function of this Utility is to provide the user with information and a platform to iteratively find the most suitable configuration of parameters for the best performing vehicle. Historically, such calculation used to be tedious and annoying at the very least, but with this utility the complex mathematical expression are taken care by the the computer and you just have to do the Brain-storming.
  Note: As we know that the torque of the motor is dependent on the current and similarly the RPM on voltage hence depending on your requirements you can choose either one to be higher over the other. Keep one thing in mind! More current thicker the cables and believe me when I say High Voltage cables are thiccc.
  This utility does not follow imperial units and all calculations are done in **Metric Unit** only, especially **MKS**.
